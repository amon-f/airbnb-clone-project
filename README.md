# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend supports the core functionalities required to mimic Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for both users and hosts.

## üèÜ Project Goals

- **User Management**:  
  Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

- **Property Management**:  
  Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.

- **Booking System**:  
  Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.

- **Payment Processing**:  
  Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

- **Review System**:  
  Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

- **Data Optimization**:  
  Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Django**  
  A high-level Python web framework used to build robust and scalable web applications. In this project, Django handles the backend logic, provides a structured framework for building RESTful APIs, and manages user authentication, routing, and middleware.

- **PostgreSQL**  
  A powerful open-source relational database system used for storing and managing structured data like users, property listings, bookings, and reviews. PostgreSQL offers strong data integrity, advanced querying, and scalability.

- **GraphQL**  
  A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. In this project, GraphQL can enhance API flexibility and efficiency, reducing the number of requests compared to traditional REST endpoints.

- **Docker**  
  A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into portable containers. Docker ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

- **Nginx**  
  A high-performance web server and reverse proxy used to serve static files, handle load balancing, and improve application performance.

- **Git & GitHub**  
  Git is a version control system that tracks code changes, while GitHub hosts the code repository, enabling collaboration, issue tracking, and version management.



## üë• Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**  
  Responsible for implementing API endpoints, designing database schemas, and writing the core business logic that powers the application. Ensures the backend services are efficient, secure, and meet project requirements.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**  
  Manages the database design, structure, and performance. Handles indexing, query optimization, backups, and ensures the integrity and security of stored data.

- **DevOps Engineer**  
  Oversees the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of backend services. Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages cloud infrastructure, and ensures system reliability and uptime.

- **QA Engineer**  
  Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested through manual and automated testing. Works to identify bugs, validate new features, and maintain overall product quality before release.
